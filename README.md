**Bridging Frontend and PLM: A React developer's journey into ARAS**

Introduction
if you had told me a year ago that i would be diving into Product Lifecycle Management and ARAS, i would have laughed. As a frontend developer with experience in React and Material UI, my world revolved around UI components, state management and making applications sleek.PLM?That sounded like something mechanical enhineers or enterprise software veterans not a frontend dev like me.
But here I am leRNING c# for ARAS developmentand realizing that frontend developers can bring a lot to the table in PLM projects. If you are React developer considering a transition into PLM then let me share a journey- the challenges, surprises and lessong learned along the way.
 Now,
What is PLM? and why should Frontnend developers care?
PLM is understanding for managing a product's entire lifecycle- from concept and design to manufufacturing, maintenance and disposal.
industries like automotive, aerospace rely on PLM platforms like ARAS innovator to handle the massive amounts of product data.

**Why Frontend devs are needed in PLM**
Traditionally, plm software a has been dominated  backend development often with complex ui built older tecjnologies.However modern PLM applications demand web based and user friendly interfaces. this is where frondend developers, espicially reactjs and material ui can add the value by:
1. improving UX: creating more responsive ui components.
2. Enhancing performance: optimizing how plm data is rendered in the browser.
3. integrating APIs: Connnecting with pl databases and backend system
4. modernizing ui: bringing plm up to today's web standards.
