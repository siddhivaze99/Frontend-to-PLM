# 🚀 From React Developer to PLM Enthusiast — My Journey of Growth and Curiosity

Hi there! 👋 I'm sharing a personal milestone — my transition from a **Frontend React Developer** to diving into the world of **PLM (Product Lifecycle Management)**.

## 🌱 My Roots: React & the Frontend World

- 2+ years of experience in React.js, JavaScript, Redux, and Material UI
- Built responsive, dynamic, and user-centric web apps
- Focused on clean architecture, reusable components, and smooth user experience

But deep down, I knew I wanted to explore more — something that merges code with strategy and deeper product insights.

## 🔁 Stepping into the World of PLM

Recently, I started working in the PLM space with a focus on **ARAS Innovator**. It was a whole new challenge — understanding how products are managed across their lifecycle, and how systems interact behind the scenes.

### What I’m Learning:
- **C# basics** for PLM configurations
- **ARAS Innovator development**
- Understanding lifecycles, workflows, and versioning
- How frontend meets backend in enterprise systems

## 💡 Why This Shift?

I’m passionate about building things — and PLM is teaching me how **products are built, managed, and evolved** from concept to reality. It’s helping me go from UI developer to **full-stack problem solver**.

## 🛠️ What’s Next?

- Deepen my C# and PLM development skills  
- Apply frontend knowledge to enhance PLM user interfaces  
- Bridge communication between devs and business teams  
- Continue writing and sharing my learnings 💬
